# Libya Scholarship Finder 🎓🇱🇾
#DISCLAIMER THIS IS STILL JUST TESTING AND STILL HAVENT ADDED THE FULL SCHOLARSHIPS OR DEVELOPED A FULLY WORKING SITE 



A web app designed to help Libyan students find scholarships based on field of study, destination country, and application deadline. Built to simplify the journey of students seeking educational opportunities abroad.

## 🌍 Why I Built This

As a Libyan student who struggled to find scholarships, I realized there was no simple tool that gathers this information in one place. I built this to support other students like me who want to study abroad but don’t know where to start.

## 🔍 Features (Planned)

- Search scholarships by:
  - 📅 Deadline
  - 📌 Destination country
  - 🎓 Field of study
- Filter for undergraduate or graduate scholarships
- Add links to official application pages
- Clean, mobile-friendly design

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- Data stored in a JSON file or connected to a Google Sheet
- (Optional) Bootstrap for styling or Tailwind later

## 🚀 Future Features

- Arabic translation toggle 🇱🇾🇬🇧
- Save favorites (using local storage)
- Admin panel to add new scholarships easily
